\section*{Problem 3}

Taking the number of butterflies $n$, and the $r$ determinations on whether they are the same
species, an $O(n + r)$ algorithm could be described using Breadth First Search, or Depth First
Search. The butterflies $n$ would be the nodes, and the determinations $r$ would be the edges.

The consistency condition could be viewed as a 3 node cycle. Because they are only 2 species, any odd number cycle would not be allowed, however an even number cycle would still allow for the consistency condition.

Performing either a BFS or DFS on the graph of determinations and if they are no odd numbered cycles then there is no contradiction in the determinations.

\section*{Problem 4}

For this problem you need to construct a graph of the relationships between the courses, and
perform a topological sort of the graph. To perform a topological sort, the graph must be acyclic
because topological sort only works in a directed acyclic graph.
